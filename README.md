# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN (VGG16 + Transfer Learning)

This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN with VGG16)** to detect brain tumors from MRI images.  
It applies **transfer learning** for better accuracy on limited data, and evaluates the model with **Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Accuracy metrics**.

---

## Features
- Transfer Learning with **VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet**
- Custom CNN layers for classification
- Trained on **MRI Brain Tumor Dataset**
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy & Loss curves
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve & AUC score
- Implemented in **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**
